This directory contains the cartoons and illustrations made by our cartoonists Pratibha, Kyle and Daniele.

### Images directory
Structure:
```{unique-url-tail}-text-{id}.jpg```

Example:
```{unique-url-tail}-text-Daniele.jpg```

The next step is first time use. We generate an image for the directory System: ```{unique-url-tail}-text-bckgrd.jpg``` and this file will be copied to _current_ right away ```{unique-url-tail}.jpg```

When one or more of cartoonist have delivered their work we add to the directory Images:
```{unique-url-tail}-text-{First name}.jpg, example criminals-text-Daniele.jpg```
and
```{unique-url-tail}-{First name}.jpg, example criminals-Daniele.jpg```

To make any illustration for a card the _current_ image:
- We COPY {unique-url-tail}-text-{First name}.jpg to {unique-url-tail}-text.jpg REPLACING the existing file
- DO NOT RENAME the file, for the image will be lost when the next refresh action takes places.
